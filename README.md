# Supplementary material of the work *Inverse Optimization with Kernel Regression: Application to the Power Forecasting and Bidding of a Fleet of Electric vehicles*

## Overview

In this repository, we provide the input data for all cases of the inverse optimization methodology described in the work entitled *Inverse Optimization with Kernel Regression: Application to the Power Forecasting and Bidding of a Fleet of Electric vehicles*.

The paper can be accessed via arxiv in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00399). This article has been developed by R. Fernandez-Blanco, J. M. Morales, S. Pineda, and A. Porras, which are members of the [OASYS group](https://sites.google.com/view/groupoasys/home), and it has been possible thanks to the funding of the project [Flexanalytics](https://groupoasysflexanalytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Database

This respository contains 5 excel files, which are related to the following cases:
 

1. input_invfor_CS0_g2v: sync grid-to-vehicle case (Section 4.2 of the paper)

2. input_invfor_CS0_v2g: sync vehicle-to-grid case (Section 4.2 of the paper)

3. input_invfor_naive: naive case (Section 4.2 of the paper)

4. input_invfor_CSnot0_g2v: non-sync grid-to-vehicle case (Section 4.3 of the paper)

5. input_invfor_CSnot0_v2g: non-sync vehicle-to-grid case (Section 4.3 of the paper)

Note that electricity prices come from day-ahead electricity prices from Spain and the observed power is coming from the MILP model described in the appendix of the paper [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00399).
