# Aggregated-EV-data


This respository contains 5 excel files with the observed aggregate power of an EV-fleet and the corresponding electricity prices. The filenames are related to the following cases:

 

1. input_invfor_CS0_g2v: sync grid-to-vehicle case

2. input_invfor_CS0_v2g: sync vehicle-to-grid case

3. input_invfor_CSnot0_g2v: non-sync grid-to-vehicle case

4. input_invfor_CSnot0_v2g: non-sync vehicle-to-grid case

5. input_invfor_naive: naive case

 

Note that electricity prices come from day-ahead electricity prices from Spain and the observed power is coming from the MILP model described in the appendix of the paper [XX].
